School Analysis

From the analysis of two data sets, student data and school data, we can conclude that the overall 72.67% of students pass both maths and reading accross 39,170 students from 15 schools in this area. There 86.07% that passed maths and 84.43% that passed reading, with an average score of 70.34 and 69.98 respectively. The budget for the area was $24,649,428 for all schools.

Top and Bottom performing schools

The school with the highest overall passing rate for both subjects was Cabrera High School with a passing rate of 80.92%, followed by Griffin High School (80.71%), Bailey High School (80.07%), Holden High School	(79.61%) and Wright High School (79.54%). Four of the top five schools were independant schools, with the exception of Bailey High school being the sole government school type amongst the top 5 performing schools. Schools with the lowest overall passing rate for both subjects was Figueroa High School with a passing rate of 67.62%, followed by Wilson High School (67.30%), Johnson High School (67.27%), Huang High School (66.54%) and Hernandez High School (66.28%). Four of the bottom five schools were government schools, with the exception of Wilson High School being the sole independant school type amongst the bottom 5 performing schools.

Reading and Maths accross by Year

Overall the average maths and reading scores for each school accross all year levels was consistent, ranging from a score of 67 to 72.

Scores by School Spending

A portion of the budget would be allocated to each individual school and based on the total number of students, there would be a calculated budget per student, this was categorised as <$585, $585-630, $630-645 and $645-680. The top performing Spending ranges (Per Student) was $585-630 with an overall 79.89% passing rate accross both maths and reading. This cotergory was also the highest for the number of students passing maths or reading with 91.52% and 87.29% respectively. The worst performing category is $645-680, an overall passing rate of 66.70%, while also have the worst passing rates for maths (81.57%) and reading (81.77%).

Scores by School Size

Schools were categorised based on the number of students, being Small (<1000), Medium (1000-2000)	and Large (2000-5000). Schools with less than 1000 students performed the best accross all areas (% Overall Passing, % Passing Maths and % Passing Reading) with rates of 79.50%, 90.81% and 87.56% respectively. Large schools performed the worst when comparing school size and their results with % Overall Passing (70.28%), % Passing Maths (84.25%) and % Passing Reading (83.30%).

Scores by School Type

Schools are considered either a Government or Independant type school, when categorised in this manner there seemed to be a significant difference between the types of school. The results heavily favour independant schools which resulted in an overall passing rate of 77.02% where as government schools had a passing rate of 70.70%. This is also reflected in the % Passing Maths and Reading. 

Conclusion

We can conclude that Overall Passing rates is heavily influence by whether a school is classed as Independant or Government, with indpendant schools having a significantly higher overall passing rate. This is also being relfected in the top and bottom performing schools, with more independant schools being the top performing and government more represented in the b.ottom performing schools. Although, there are exceptions such as Bailey Highschool being the sole government school type amongst the top 5 performing schools and Wilson High School being the sole independant school type amongst the bottom 5 performing schools. We can also conclude that higher school budgets per student does not result in a better overall passing rate, with the $645-680 being the worst performing catergory and $585-630 being the best performing in this category. The total number of students within a school seems to heavily influence the Overall Passing rate of students, indicating that smaller schools performed the best and larger schools being worse. From the previous conclusions, we can suspect government schools, which usually have a large number of students and a higher budget allocation require more assistance in improving their overall performance beyond being allocated more budget.
